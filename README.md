My attempt to solve [Advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) while practicing typescript.

Not all solutions are most optimal, some solutions even take couple of minutes to run, but all of them are 100% mine. No reddit used ;)

One exception though > I couldn't find a proper library to solve equations on day 24, so I got some help to find Z3 solver.
